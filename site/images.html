                They told me all of my cages were mental
                So I got wasted like all my potential
                And my words shoot to kill when I'm mad
                I have a lot of regrets about that
                I was so ahead of the curve, the curve became a sphere
                Fell behind on my classmates, and I ended up here
                Pouring out my heart to a stranger
                But I didn't pour the whiskey

                So we could call it even
                You could call me babe for the weekend
                'Tis the damn season, write this down
                I'm stayin' at my parents' house
                And the road not taken looks real good now
                And it always leads to you in my hometown
